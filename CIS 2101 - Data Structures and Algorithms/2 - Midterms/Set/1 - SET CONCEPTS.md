### Overview
A set is a collection of distinct elements, which can be either basic objects like integers or other sets. The elements are unordered, and no duplicates are allowed. Sets are often organized with a linear order, where each element is compared using a relation like "<" (less than), which is transitive and ensures one element is either less than, equal to, or greater than another.

### Basic Set Operations
The most basic operations on sets are union, intersection, and difference. If A and B are sets then

1. `Union` - The union of A and B, written as $A \cup B$, is the set of elements that are members of A or B or both.
2. `Intersection`- The intersection of A and B, written as $A \cap B$, is the set of elements in both A and B.
3. `Difference` - The difference of A and B, written as $A - B$, is the set of elements in A that are not in B.

For example, if $A = \{a, b, c\}$ and $B = \{b, d\}$, then
$A \cup B = \{a, b, c, d\}$
$A \cap B = \{b\}$
$A - B = \{a, c\}$
