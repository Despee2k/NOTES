### Overview
In an array-based implementation of a list, elements are stored in consecutive memory locations. This makes it straightforward to traverse the list and to append new elements to its end. However, inserting an element in the middle of the list requires shifting all subsequent elements to create space, and deleting any element (except the last) involves shifting elements to fill the gap left by the removed item.
